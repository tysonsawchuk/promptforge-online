# PromptForge Master Plan (LOCK FILE)
_Last updated: 2025-07-01_

---

## 🌑 **THE VISION**
- PromptForge is a **viral, dark-humor, “forbidden” prompt tool** designed to break AI censors and inspire creativity, not just for the creator, but for *everyone* struggling with mainstream AI art tools.
- All core features should feel hackerish, smartass, transgressive, and “alive.”
- The site must balance **edgy, NSFW energy** (for underground cred & clickbait) with **enough SFW polish** for AdSense and mainstream growth.
- **Nothing is final unless it’s in this file and you’ve approved it.**
