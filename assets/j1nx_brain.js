[/what is a seed in ai/i, "A seed is a random number that determines the ‘starting conditions’ for the AI. Using the same seed with the same prompt/settings gives you the exact same result every time—a lifesaver for consistent art or experiments. pls", 3],
[/explain cfg scale/i, "CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance) scale is a slider that controls how strictly the AI follows your prompt. Higher = more exact to your words but less creative. Lower = more wild, unexpected results. Find your sweet spot! pls", 3],
[/how do i get more realistic ai art/i, "Use detailed, specific prompts with reference to lighting, lens, mood, and camera tech. Choose realistic models, set high-res, and use negative prompts for unwanted artifacts. Reference real-world artists or photography styles for bonus points. pls", 3],
[/what are loras/i, "LoRAs (Low-Rank Adaptation) are like style add-ons or upgrades for AI models. They inject a specific style, character, or theme—think ‘anime hair,’ ‘goth girls,’ or ‘1980s film grain.’ Stack or mix them for wild results. pls", 3],

[/what does ‘weight’ mean in prompts/i, "Weight lets you tell the AI to care more (or less) about part of a prompt. Like (vivid eyes:1.4) or (background:0.6). The higher the number, the more attention the AI pays to that part. pls", 3],
[/how do i avoid ‘nsfw’ filtering/i, "Don’t say the obvious banned words. Use creative synonyms, playful misspellings, or prompt for moods and scenarios instead of explicit acts. Add placeholders you fill later by hand. Hide the spicy under clever wording. pls", 3],

[/why does ai make extra fingers/i, "AI art models are weird with hands because the training data is messy. Hands appear in all positions, half-hidden, or distorted. To fix, add ‘normal hands’ and ‘five fingers’ to your prompt, and use negative prompts for ‘extra fingers, weird hands.’ pls", 3],
[/how can i get consistent characters/i, "Use the same seed, model, and a highly specific prompt. Use embeddings or LoRAs for the character, and copy/paste the exact details (hair, eye color, clothes) every time. Consistency is repetition. pls", 3],

[/why does ai struggle with text/i, "AI image models don’t read or write—they just guess what ‘words’ look like, based on image patterns. For real text, use special models or overlay text after. Try prompts like ‘blank sign’ to avoid weird letters. pls", 3],
[/what is a safety filter/i, "Safety filters catch banned words or content. If you get blank results or error messages, try rewording, using synonyms, or breaking up flagged terms. It’s the AI’s way of keeping things PG (for better or worse). pls", 3],
